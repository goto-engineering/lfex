# Lisp Flavored Elixir

Inspired by Lispex and LFE.

## Todo

1.Use macros - defmodule, defn
1.Error handling - don't just crash the REPL
1.Function references
1.Compile source files to .beam bytecode
1.Pattern matching - let?
1.Anonymous fn syntax? Elixir syntax, Clojure syntax, ES6 syntax?
1.Dashes in fn names?
1.Cool REPL functions like call count
1.Structs
1.How does threading work? |>? Clojure style ->? Implement as macro?
1.Define user macros?
